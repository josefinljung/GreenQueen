            In our restaurant you can enjoy the greener alternative with Plant Based Street Food, burgers, wines, quesadillas, gluten-free beers, kebabs, green smoothies, power shots and vegan snacks.
            Our inspiration comes mostly from Los Angeles, where the concept has long existed.
            We focus our menu with plant-based food and drink.
            We have created a sitting area where you can cuddle at the corner on the sunny side or on-the-go and feel free to bring your food down to the barges at Mälarpaviljongen, or why not a picnic in Rålis.
            How about a Spicy Corn and Chick Pea Burger or Smashed Avocado toast with homemade chili salsa and an ice cold beer? The food and drink we serve is mostly organic and, as we call it, "CLEAN", i.e. free from gluten, lactose and refined sugar.
            With us it is about being able to sin with a good conscience.
